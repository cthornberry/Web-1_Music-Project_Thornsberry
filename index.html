</div>

<section class="about">
    <p> Sir Robert Bryson Hall II was born on January 22, 1990, at Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland. He was born to Robert Bryson Hall, an African-American Maryland native, and a Caucasian mother. Logic spent much of his youth in the West Deer Park neighborhood in Gaithersburg, Maryland. His father suffered from a cocaine addiction and his mother suffered from alcoholism. Despite his father initially being absent in his childhood, Logic was able to reconnect with Hall due to his burgeoning rap career. During his early adolescent years, Logic witnessed his brothers produce and distribute crack cocaine to "addicts all over the block", including to his father. Logic maintains that he accurately knows how to manufacture and produce crack cocaine following these experiences. He attended neighboring Gaithersburg High School. However, he did not graduate and was soon expelled after he began skipping classes in the tenth grade. Logic would comment on the expulsion, stating "I started doing badly and failed every class but English, so they kicked me out of school, they gave up on me."

<section class="music">
  <p>Raised in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Logic developed an interest in music as a teenager, and ventured into a musical career in early 2009, releasing Logic: The Mixtape and a mixtape titled Young, Broke & Infamous in 2010. He then signed with Visionary Music Group, and subsequently released three additional mixtapes over three years. His fourth mixtape, Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever (2013), was released to critical acclaim and allowed Logic to secure a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. His debut studio album Under Pressure was released in 2014 and peaked at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was eventually certified gold. Alongside its follow-up The Incredible True Story (2015). After releasing his debut commercial mixtape Bobby Tarantino in 2016, he released his third studio album Everybody in 2017.
  Everybody marked a breakthrough in his career, as it became his first to peak at number one on the Billboard 200, and was his first to become certified platinum. The album also contained the single "1-800-273-8255", which reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally. His next two releases- Bobby Tarantino II and his fourth album YSIV- were both released in 2018; each debuted within the top-two on the Billboard 200.
  In 2019, he released his fifth album Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, which also reached number one. It also contained a collaboration with Eminem titled "Homicide", which peaked at number five on the Hot 100.
  Outside of music, Logic has released a novel titled Supermarket (2019), which was accompanied by a soundtrack of the same name. The book became a New York Times Best Seller.

  </div>
<section class="record_lable" id="records">
  <p>BobbyBoy Records’ initial artist roster is comprised of critically-acclaimed artists who have recorded with Logic in the past.
  Singer-songwriter John Lindahl, Damian Lemar Hudson, Big Lenbo and Kajo are the first wave of artists Logic plans to release on BobbyBoy.
  “Backing for my label to support the artists I believe in is a dream come true and I am so excited to give my fans something even more in this next chapter of my life," Logic explained. "The RattPack just got a whole lot bigger! I pray everyone will support them as you have me over the years! Juggling something of this magnitude is no easy feat, but my artists make it easy.”
  The current boss over at Def Jam agrees with Logic's assessment and said the rapper had assembled the proper team to take BobbyBoy to another level.
