  <h2> "About Logic" text-algin: left </h2>

  <p> Sir Robert Bryson Hall II was born on January 22, 1990, at Shady Grove Hospital]in Rockville, Maryland. He was born to Robert Bryson Hall, an African-American Maryland native, and a Caucasian mother. Logic spent much of his youth in the West Deer Park neighborhood in Gaithersburg, Maryland. His father suffered from a cocaine addiction and his mother suffered from alcoholism.Despite his father initially being absent in his childhood, Logic was able to reconnect with Hall due to his burgeoning rap career. During his early adolescent years, Logic witnessed his brothers produce and distribute crack cocaine to "addicts all over the block", including to his father. Logic maintains that he accurately knows how to manufacture and produce crack cocaine following these experiences. He attended neighboring Gaithersburg High School. However, he did not graduate and was soon expelled after he began skipping classes in the tenth grade. Logic would comment on the expulsion, stating "I started doing badly and failed every class but English, so they kicked me out of school, they gave up on me."
